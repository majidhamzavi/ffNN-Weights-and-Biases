# ffNN-Weight-and-Biases
Feed Forward Neural Network- generate and optimize random Weights and Biases

In this repository, I will explain how to create random weights and biaes for a 2-layer neural network (NN). Based on how many layers and neurons you might have in NN, you need to generate random wieghts and biases and implement ffNN explained in the prvious repository (https://github.com/majidhamzavi/feedforwardNN). Same as
